//   Here is an image inspector, but the buttons are not implemented yet, that will
//   be your task!
//    - the nav buttons (up, down, left, right) move the background by 10px
//    - the zoom buttons increase/decrease the image by 20%
//    - attach only two event listeners to the nav element
//      - one for navigation
//      - one for zooming
